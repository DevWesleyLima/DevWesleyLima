👨‍💼My passion has always been technology and electronic devices. I remember how fascinated I was when I first played a game called RuneScape (JAGEX - 2001/2002). Over the years this passion has only increased and now I spend most of my time in front of the computer (studying, working, learning and developing new skills or even having fun with friends); however, this goes beyond mere entertainment. I actively use technology for continuous learning and professional development, consistently improving my skills and exploring new areas of expertise. This dedication to growth ensures I remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving technological landscape.
