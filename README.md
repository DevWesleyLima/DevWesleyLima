👨‍💼 About me

I was born in a humble family where I had the opportunity to learn the meaning of the words respect, honesty and responsibility. I am polite, dedicated, individually motivated and can work very well as a part of a team. I also have excellent IT, accounting, consulting and finance related skills.

My passion has always been technology and electronic devices. I remember how fascinated I was when I first played a game called RuneScape (JAGEX - 2001/2002). Over the years this passion has only increased and now I spend most of my time in front of the computer (studying, working, learning and developing new skills or even having fun with friends).
